According to the latest figures issued by the US Department of Labor, inflation in the United States reached a three-decade high in January '22, with prices of consumer goods and services rising by 8% year over year."

    "Supply chain problems are having a significant effect on the economy right now. Inventory-to-sale ratios have hit record lows across the economy and in the retail sector. Homebuilders say they don't have enough materials, and automakers don't have enough semiconductors. The fire is getting hotter because more people want to buy things. Travel demand, for example, has come back a lot faster than expected, which is straining airlines. In the same way, the number of vehicles sold in April more than doubled from last year, which is leaving dealer lots empty. Prices have gone up because of a rise in demand and a supply chain that isn't fully operational.\n"
